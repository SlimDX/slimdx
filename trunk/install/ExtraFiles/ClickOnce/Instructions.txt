This folder needs to be copied to "\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages" on the user's computer.
There are a set of registry keys for this location:
  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\GenericBootstrapper\1.0
  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\GenericBootstrapper\3.5
  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\GenericBootstrapper\4.0
Under my x64 machine the registry keys are in this location:
  HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\GenericBootstrapper\1.0
  HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\GenericBootstrapper\3.5
  HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\GenericBootstrapper\4.0

The Key in each case is "Path"

The License.rtf file should be copied to ClickOnce/en/
The MSI for the runtime should be copied to ClickOnce/

The GUID for the MSI should be copied into the product.xml file, in the MsiProductCheck element
The name of the MSI for the runtime should be copied into the product.xml file, in the PackageFile element as well as the Command element
The ProductCode in the product.xml file should match the SlimDX version
The Command element in the product.xml should be adjusted for the runtime installed size in bytes

The DisplayName string in en/package.xml should be modified to the correct string
The SlimDXHomeSite string in en/package.xml should be modified to the correct download location

The folder should be renamed from "ClickOnce" to something version specific, such as "sdx20942"
