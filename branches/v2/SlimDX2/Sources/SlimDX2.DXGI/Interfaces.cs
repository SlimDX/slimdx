For more information about acquiring this reference, see the following code example.The AcquireSync method uses the key as follows, depending on the state of the surface:On initial creation, the surface is unowned and any device can call the AcquireSync method to gain access.  For an unowned device, only a key of 0 will succeed. Calling the AcquireSync method for any other key will stall the  calling CPU thread.If the surface is owned by a device when you call the AcquireSync method, the CPU thread that called  the AcquireSync method will stall until the owning device calls the {{ReleaseSync}} method  using the same Key.If the surface is unowned when you call the AcquireSync method (for example, the last owning device has already called  the {{ReleaseSync}} method), the AcquireSync method will succeed if you specify the same key  that was specified when the ReleaseSync method was last called. Calling the AcquireSync method using  any other key will cause a stall.When the owning device calls the {{ReleaseSync}} method with a particular key, and more than one device is waiting after  calling the  AcquireSync method using the same key, any one of the waiting devices could be woken up first.  The order in which devices are woken up is undefined.A keyed mutex does not support recursive calls to the AcquireSync method.

This method uses a key to determine which device currently has exclusive access to the surface.When a surface is created using the D3D10_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED_KEYEDMUTEX value of the {{D3D10_RESOURCE_MISC_FLAG}} enumeration,  you must call the <see cref="SlimDX2.DXGI.KeyedMutex.AcquireSync"/> method before rendering to the surface.  You must call the ReleaseSync method when you are done  rendering to a surface.After you call the ReleaseSync method, the shared resource is unset from the rendering pipeline. To acquire a reference to the keyed mutex object of a shared resource, call the {{QueryInterface}} method of the resource and pass in  the UUID of the <see cref="SlimDX2.DXGI.KeyedMutex"/> interface.  For more information about acquiring this reference, see the following code example.

For example, when matching Resolution, the display mode list will have already been filtered by a certain ScanlineOrdering,  Scaling, and Format, while RefreshRate is ignored. This ordering doesn't define the absolute ordering for every usage scenario of FindClosestMatchingMode, because  the application can choose some values initially, effectively changing the order that fields are chosen.Fields of the display mode are matched one at a time, generally in a specified order.If a field is unspecified, FindClosestMatchingMode gravitates toward the values for the desktop related to this output.  If this output is not part of the desktop, then the default desktop output is used to find values. If an application uses a fully unspecified  display mode, FindClosestMatchingMode will typically return a display mode that matches the desktop settings for this output.   Unspecified fields are lower priority than specified fields and will be resolved later than specified fields.

        /// The combination of WindowHandle and Flags informs DXGI to stop monitoring window messages for the previously-associated window.If the application switches to full-screen mode, DXGI will choose a full-screen resolution to be the smallest supported resolution that is larger or the same size as the current back buffer size.Applications can make some changes to make the transition from windowed to full screen more efficient. For example, on a WM_SIZE message, the application should release any outstanding swap-chain back buffers, call <see cref="SlimDX2.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers"/>, then re-acquire the back buffers from the swap chain(s). This gives the swap chain(s) an opportunity to resize the back buffers, and/or recreate them to enable full-screen flipping operation. If the application does not perform this sequence, DXGI will still make the full-screen/windowed transition, but may be forced to use a stretch operation (since the back buffers may not be the correct size), which may be less efficient. Even if a stretch is not required, presentation may not be optimal because the back buffers might not be directly interchangeable with the front buffer. Thus, a call to ResizeBuffers on WM_SIZE is always recommended, since WM_SIZE is always sent during a fullscreen transition.While windowed, the application can, if it chooses, restrict the size of its window's client area to sizes to which it is comfortable rendering. A fully flexible application would make no such restriction, but UI elements or other design considerations can, of course, make this flexibility untenable. If the application further chooses to restrict its window's client area to just those that match supported full-screen resolutions, the application can field WM_SIZING, then check against <see cref="SlimDX2.DXGI.Output.FindClosestMatchingMode"/>. If a matching mode is found, allow the resize. (The IDXGIOutput can be retrieved from <see cref="SlimDX2.DXGI.SwapChain.GetContainingOutput"/>. Absent subsequent changes to desktop topology, this will be the same output that will be chosen when alt-enter is fielded and fullscreen mode is begun for that swap chain.)Applications that want to handle mode changes or Alt+Enter themselves should call MakeWindowAssociation with the DXGI_MWA_NO_WINDOW_CHANGES flag after swap chain creation. The WindowHandle argument, if non-NULL, specifies that the application message queues will not be handled by the DXGI runtime for all swap chains of a particular target {{HWND}}.  Calling MakeWindowAssociation with the DXGI_MWA_NO_WINDOW_CHANGES flag after swapchain creation ensures that DXGI will not interfere with application's handling of window mode changes or Alt+Enter.

This can reduce presentation performance if the swap chain size and the output window size do not match. Here are two ways to ensure the sizes match:Create a windowed swap chain and then set it full-screen using <see cref="SlimDX2.DXGI.SwapChain.SetFullscreenState"/>.Save a pointer to the swap-chain immediately after creation, and use it to get the output window size during a WM_SIZE event. Then resize the swap chain buffers (with <see cref="SlimDX2.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers"/>) during the transition from windowed to full-screen.If the swap chain is in full-screen mode, before you release it, you must use {{SetFullscreenState}} to switch it to windowed mode.
